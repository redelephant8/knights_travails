This program finds the shortest route between 2 squares of a chess board for a knight. The program then lists to the user the amount of turns it will take and where the knight will have to go in order to make his journey. 

Example: If the user tells the chess piece to go from [0,0] to [7,7], opposite corners on the chess board, the program will return: 

You made it in 6 moves! Here's your path:
